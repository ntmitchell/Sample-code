Description:
	My fianc√©e asked me to write the story of my proposal to her,
	as told from my perspective, for our wedding website. However the site
	constrained our entries to at most 2,000 characters.

	I quickly wrote this script so that I can write my story in a text file
	and get a nearly-live character count.

Execution example:
	In command line,
	./check_character_count.py FILE_PATH/mystory.txt
